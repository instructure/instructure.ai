# Project Overview

## Technologies Used

This project is a web application that is deployed to GitHub Pages as a static site in a directory based on the package name. It is built using modern web technologies and follows best practices for accessibility, performance, and maintainability. The application is designed to be responsive and works well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. It does not have a database and does not require user authentication. It is built with [React 19](https://react.dev/reference/react), [Typescript Native](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go), and [InstUI](https://instructure.design/). The project is set up with [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) for fast development and build times, [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/guides/getting-started/) for code quality and formatting, and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/) for testing.

## Coding Standards

You should use the provided components and utilities from InstUI to build your application. Prefer InstUI over raw HTML and CSS or other libraries. Follow the coding standards and best practices outlined in the documentation to ensure consistency and maintainability. Prefer functional components and hooks over class components. Use TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience. Prefer built-ins over recommending new dependencies. Ensure your code is well-documented and includes comments where necessary. The meta-package `@instructure/ui` is installed; do not try to install individual packages.
